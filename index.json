Here, we use persistent homology, an emergent type of topological data analysis, to understand MRO structure in sodium silicate glasses. To enable this analysis, we introduce a self-consistent categorization of rings with rigorous geometrical definitions of the structural entities. Furthermore, we enable quantitative comparison of the persistence diagrams by computing the cumulative sum of all points weighted by their lifetime. On the basis of these analysis methods, we show that the approach can be used to deconvolute the contributions of various MRO features to the FSDP. More generally, the developed methodology can be applied to analyze and categorize molecular dynamics data and understand MRO structure in any class of amorphous solids.","tags":[],"title":"Revealing hidden medium-range order in amorphous materials using topological data analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" x=seq(0,1,0.1) print(x) ## [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 ","date":1597795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597852402,"objectID":"52f169810912874166aaeb48afa36624","permalink":"https://biscio.github.io/post/test/","publishdate":"2020-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/test/","section":"post","summary":" x=seq(0,1,0.1) print(x) ## [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 ","tags":[],"title":"TEST","type":"post"},{"authors":["Biscio","C.A.N.","Chenavier N.","Hirsch C.","Svane A.M."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597586175,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597586175,"objectID":"a3216b446d5a633ef1496203cac47ba2","permalink":"https://biscio.github.io/publication/2020_bchs_tda/","publishdate":"2020-08-16T15:56:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_bchs_tda/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce tests for the goodness of fit of point patterns via methods from topological data analysis.

These time series have to be analyzed to create value. A fundamental type of analysis is to find temporal correlations between given sets of time series. To provide a robust method for solving this problem, several properties are desirable. First, the method should have a strong theoretical foundation. Second, since temporal correlations can occur at different temporal scales, e.g., sub-second versus weekly, it is important that the method is capable of discovering multitemporal scale correlations. Finally, the method should be efficient and scalable. This paper presents an approach to search for synchronous correlations in big time series that displays all three properties: the proposed method (i) utilizes the metric of mutual information from information theory, providing a strong theoretical foundation, (ii) is able to discover correlations at multiple temporal scales, and (iii) works in an efficient, bottom-up fashion, making it scalable to large datasets. Our experiments verify that the proposed approach can identify various types of correlation relations across multiple temporal scales, while achieving a performance of an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient bottom-up discovery of multi-scale time series correlations using mutual information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaiban","C.","Biscio","C.A.N.","Thanapongtharm","W.","Tildesley","M.","Xiao","X.","Robinson","T.P.","Van-wambeke","S.O. \u0026 Gilbert","M."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565966521,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565966521,"objectID":"bfe567b057aad2d7c935e9f92b54c22d","permalink":"https://biscio.github.io/publication/2019_chaiban_agriculture/","publishdate":"2019-08-16T16:42:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_chaiban_agriculture/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent decades, intensification of animal production has been occurring rapidly in transition economies to meet the growing demands of increasingly urban populations. This comes with significant environmental, health and social impacts. To assess these impacts, detailed maps of livestock distributions have been developed by downscaling census data at the pixel level (10km or 1km), providing estimates of the density of animals in each pixel. However, these data remain at fairly coarse scale and many epidemiological or environmental science applications would make better use of data where the distribution and size of farms are predicted rather than the number of animals per pixel. Based on detailed 2010 census data, we investigated the spatial point pattern distribution of extensive and intensive chicken farms in Thailand. We parameterized point pattern simulation models for extensive and intensive chicken farms and evaluated these models in different parts of Thailand for their capacity to reproduce the correct level of spatial clustering and the most likely locations of the farm clusters. We found that both the level of clustering and location of clusters could be simulated with reasonable accuracy by our farm distribution models. Furthermore, intensive chicken farms tended to be much more clustered than extensive farms, and their locations less easily predicted using simple spatial factors such as human populations. These point-pattern simulation models could be used to downscale coarse administrative level livestock census data into farm locations. This methodology could be of particular value in countries where farm location data are unavailable.","tags":[],"title":"Point pattern simulation modelling of extensive and intensive chicken farming in Thailand: Accounting for clustering and landscape characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Test $$\\mathcal{L}(f)(x)= \\Delta \\frac{1}{3}$$\nx=seq(0,1,0.2) plot(x,x^2)   Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Briefly, a persistence diagram is a multiset of points in the plane describing the persistence of topological features of a compact set when a scale parameter varies. Since statistical methods are difficult to apply directly on persistence diagrams, various alternative functional summary statistics have been suggested, but either they do not contain the full information of the persistence diagram or they are two-dimensional functions. We suggest a new functional summary statistic that is one-dimensional and hence easier to handle, and which under mild conditions contains the full information of the persistence diagram. Its usefulness is illustrated in statistical settings concerned with point clouds and brain artery trees. The supplementary materials include additional methods and examples, technical details, and the R code used for all examples.","tags":[],"title":"The accumulated persistence function, a new useful functional summary statistic for topological data analysis, with a view to brain artery trees and spatial point process applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biscio","C.A.N.","Poinas","A. \u0026 Waagepetersen","R."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1534431497,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534431497,"objectID":"de096010aefa55daa19dd89e78288751","permalink":"https://biscio.github.io/publication/2018_poinas_waagepetersen/","publishdate":"2018-08-16T16:58:17+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_poinas_waagepetersen/","section":"publication","summary":"We fill two gaps in the literature on central limit theorems.

We consider two ways to quantify the repulsiveness of a point process, both based on its second-order properties, and we address the question of how repulsive a stationary DPP can be. We determine the most repulsive stationary DPP, when the intensity is fixed, and for a given $R0$ we investigate repulsiveness in the subclass of $R$-dependent stationary DPPs, that is, stationary DPPs with $R$-compactly supported kernels. Finally, in both the general case and the $R$-dependent case, we present some new parametric families of stationary DPPs that can cover a large range of DPPs, from the stationary Poisson process (the case of no interaction) to the most repulsive DPP.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying repulsiveness of determinantal point processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://biscio.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
